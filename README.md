# Sudoku-solver

Speed-uptimized automatic soduko solver using two different algorithms: 1. AC-3 algorithm (short for Arc Consistency Algorithm #3) 2. BTS (Back Tracking Search)
In both cases, a soduko puzzle is viewed as a 'constraint satisfaction problem'.

The algorithms are implemented with in Python.

I originally made a version of this project as part of Columbia University's "Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters Program" (this course is now hosted here: https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence). Later I've made a simple web app made with Flask and JavaScript.
