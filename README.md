# Sudoku-solver
Automatic soduko solver using two different algorithms:
 1) AC-3 algorithm (short for Arc Consistency Algorithm #3)
 2) BTS (Back Tracking Search)
In both cases, a soduko puzzle is viewed as a 'constraint satisfaction problem'.

The algorithms are implemented with in Python. 

I originally did this project as part of the "Columbia's Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters Program" (https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence). Later I've made a somple web app made with Flask and vanilla JS.
