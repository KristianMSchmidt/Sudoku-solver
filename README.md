Automatic sudoku-solver using AC-3 and backtracking algorithms. The algorithms are implemented with in Python. 
I originally did this project as part of the "Columbia's Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters Program" (https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence). Later I've made a somple web app made with Flask and vanilla JS.
