# Sudoku-solver

Speed-uptimized automatic soduko solver using two different algorithms:

1. AC-3 algorithm (short for Arc Consistency Algorithm #3)

2. BTS (Back Tracking Search).

In both cases, a soduko puzzle is viewed as a 'constraint satisfaction problem'.

The algorithms are implemented with in Python.

I originally made a version of this project as an assignment for Columbia University's "Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters Program". Later I've made a simple web app made with Flask and JavaScript.

The web app is live here: http://kristianmschmidt.pythonanywhere.com/.
